## 🚀 Overview

**BLUE AI** is a next-generation large language model, designed for scalability and adaptability across various model sizes of **LLAMA3**.

At its core, BLUE is a **reimplementation of Meta’s LLaMA 3 family** of text models — fully modular and designed to **scale effortlessly** from lightweight inference on consumer hardware to multi-GPU inference with large parameter sets.

BLUE also integrates a **web-based RAG system**, enabling it to **search the internet in real time**, retrieve relevant context, and use that knowledge to craft accurate and up-to-date responses.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 💡 Scalable Model Architecture
- Choose from **1B → 405B** parameter configurations.
- Switch between models with ease.
- Built with **efficiency, extensibility**, and **hardware flexibility** in mind.

### 🌐 Web-Based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Optional RAG mode allows BLUE to:
  1. Query the web for real-time data.  
  2. Retrieve relevant info.  
  3. Integrate retrieved knowledge into its response generation.
- Keeps BLUE’s knowledge base **fresh and contextually aware**.

### 🧩 Configurable and Extensible - Default model: llama-3.2-3B-instruct - Swap configurations and weights easily:
```bash
 CONFIGURATIONS = { "DIM": 3072,
                    "FFN_DIM": 8192,
                    "N_LAYERS": 28,
                    "N_HEADS": 24,
                    "N_KV_HEADS": 8,
                    "VOCAB_SIZE": 128256,              # To change the model, just update the values with the desired models values.
                    "NORM_EPS": 1e-5,
                    "ROPE_THETA": 500000,
                    "MAX_BATCH_SIZE": 2,
                    "MAX_SEQ_LEN": 10000,
                    "N_KV_HEAD_REP": 24 // 8,
                    "HEAD_DIM": 128 }

tok_DIR = "Weights/3B-instruct//original/tokenizer.model"    # Change the path with the actual path of the desired models downloaded weights.
weight_DIR = "./Weights/3B-instruct/original/consolidated.00.pth"
